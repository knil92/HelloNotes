Hello Notes
This was a quick note taking app that I created. When you are done taking notes, click the add notes button and it will add it to a html file. 
You can see your previous notes by clicking open notes page. The subject of the notes will be at the top of the page, and clicking on them will take you to those notes.
To make text go to a new line, you have to use the html tag <br/> and this will put in a line break.
